# Tic Tac Toe
 This project is a console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, built using C++. The game allows two players to take turns placing their markers ('X' and 'O') on a 3x3 grid. It includes input validation, win/draw condition checks, and a simple user interface. This project demonstrates the use of 2D arrays, functions, and basic game logic in C++.
